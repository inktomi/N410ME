Here's a short - and probably incomplete - listing of what you should practice and learn before starting on a Vans RV.
I have yet to start on mine due to waiting on replacement parts for the laser cut parts in my kit, so I'm spending
the time practicing.

## Rivets

You will need to be good at rivets. Squeezed rivets, bucked rivets, blind rivets ("pop rivets"), back-riveted rivets.
Get some sheet metal and try out all these methods. Put in dimpled flush rivets, put in rivets that are not flush. Practice
drilling them out - the domes on the top of non-flush rivets make that much harder than you'd think. Back riveting is easy, but
it's easy to bend over rivets while doing it if you're not careful to hold the gun perfectly. Put in a couple hundred rivets,
and drill them out. Drill them out till you can do it without enlarging the hole. Then do it some more.

## Rolling sheet metal edges

Wherever a skin overlays another you will want to roll its edge just slightly. This is done manually by passing it in between
two rollers - way easier to say than to do! Practice this till you can get something you'd be happy with on your plane.

## Vans Practice Kits

I'd suggest getting both the toolbox and the control surface kit. The toolbox is a good way to practice rivets, and the control
surface has some back riveting and lots of "real world" stuff you'll have to do on the plane.

I'll add more to this as I think of things. I'm just now getting started.
